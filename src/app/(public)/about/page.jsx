                  <p>
                  Annadata, which means "Provider of Food" in Sanskrit, embodies our commitment to ensuring that no one goes to bed hungry. Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea - to bridge the gap between the excess food from events and the pressing needs of those who lack a meal.

                  <p>
                  At Annadata, our mission is to collect surplus food from weddings, parties, and gatherings, and transform it into a source of hope and nourishment for the less fortunate. We believe in the transformative power of food, not only as sustenance but also as a symbol of care, love, and shared humanity.
